# Plant Disease Detection

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a robust and efficient solution for detecting plant diseases using advanced machine learning techniques. Its primary goal is to assist farmers in identifying plant diseases at an early stage and to provide actionable insights to improve crop yield and health. By minimizing agricultural losses, this project supports sustainable farming practices.

## Requirements

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling arrays efficiently.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data with plots and charts.
- **Seaborn**: For aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and pre-processing.
- **Flask**: For creating the web-based user interface and connecting it to the backend model.

## Technical Stack

### Programming Languages:
- Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Frameworks/Libraries:
- Flask (Web Framework)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Machine Learning)

### Dataset:
- Kaggle Plant Disease Dataset

### Tools/Platforms:
- Jupyter Notebook for model development.
- Visual Studio Code for coding.
- GitHub for version control.

## Architecture/Design

### Components:
1. **Frontend**: A web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for uploading images and displaying results.
2. **Backend**: A Flask application that pre-processes images, performs model inference, and delivers results.
3. **Deep Learning Model**: A CNN trained to classify 38 plant disease categories from leaf images.

### Design Decisions:
- **Model Architecture**: The CNN has three convolutional layers with max-pooling, dropout for overfitting prevention, and a softmax output for classifying plant disease categories.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping improve the model's robustness.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Flask ensures seamless interaction between the web interface and the model.
